<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Honoured Sir:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is with regret and sorrow that I enclose at last the
long-protracted translations of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
answer to your letter. His sudden passing to the Great Beyond has
plunged us all in profound grief and added heavily to our
preoccupations and responsibilities. Happily, however, the full
answer to your epistle, had been written, and signed by him many days
before his passing and were it not for the desire to have it
adequately rendered into English and French, it would have reached
you far sooner than now. As I am not certain of your address at the
present moment, I am enclosing a copy of the original text which
bears his signature, hoping to forward the text as soon as I am
assured of your true address.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I am sending, too, a copy of the English version to Mr.
A. Iṣfáhání, a Bahá’í
friend of ours who, I understand, has had the pleasure and privilege
of meeting you on more than one occasion, and who I am sure will
submit it to you, should this letter fail to reach its destination.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Bahá’ís the world over will be
delighted to have copies of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
answer to your letter circulated amongst them, as it is unique in
many respects and much appreciated in its nature and
comprehensiveness. I have refrained from giving them copies until I
hear of your desire to do so.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Being a personal letter I thought it incumbent upon me
to inform you and request you on this point.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My very best wishes and kind regards and hoping to hear
from you soon,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I am yours very sincerely <br />

friends in those regions raise the Call of Yá-Bahá’u’l-Abhá
and stimulate interest in the Cause of God. He is indeed qualified
for such an eminent noble task and I am confident that by the Grace
of God and with the whole-hearted assistance of the loved ones of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, he may be enabled to promote far and
wide the universal Teachings of Bahá’u’lláh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His wide experience and familiarity with the various
aspects of the Movement, his profound and extensive knowledge of its
history; his association with some of the early believers, the
pioneers and martyrs of the Cause will I am sure to appeal to every
one of you and will serve to acquaint you still further with the more
intimate and tragic side of this remarkable Movement.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">May his sojourn in your country lend a fresh impetus to
the onward march of the Cause in the West and arouse widespread
interest in the history as well as the principles of the Bahá’í

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">15 February 1926</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to your first question on alcohol and
drinking Bahá’u’lláh fully aware of the
great misery that it brings about, prohibits it as He expressly
states that everything that takes away the mind or in other words
makes one drunk is forbidden. The Master has promoted the same idea.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In connection with spiritualism, although the Master
says that there is some element of truth in what some teach under the
subject of auto-suggestion and others, spiritualism as such is not
taught by the Bahá’í religion. Our Master has
said that religion and true science must go together and most of
these things have not been proved by science.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to your third question Shoghi Effendi would like you
to understand that when one believes in one to be divinely inspired
and when one is convinced that he has a great mission to the world in
his teachings, he must very naturally be ready to accept all that
that world-teacher that divinely-inspired man says. It is with this
view that he feels that a real Bahá’í would be
one who is convinced that Bahá’u’lláh was a
world-teacher and a Messenger of God bearing to mankind a great
Message, and would therefore be ready to accept all that Bahá’u’lláh
has said and the same is true of the Master whom we believe to have
been the great propounder of the Bahá’í teachings
and the one through whom the Covenant of God was firmly established
in the world.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to the differentiation between Bahá’í
and Bahá’í friend. This differentiation was not
one which Bahá’u’lláh and the Master firmly
established but because there are so many people who are attracted to
the Bahá’í Cause just as they are attracted to
some society and people who have not developed spiritually to look at
the world and the spiritual elements of life in the proper light that
a Bahá’í would look at it, it has become a habit
of differentiating between what you might call beginners in the
Bahá’í Movement and those who have studied the
Movement thoroughly and who know its teachings exactly and who
understand the real spirit that is back of it all. You should not
think, however, that a Bahá’í is one who is
superior to a Bahá’í friend, but only that he has
studied the Movement better and realizes well the great and divine
spirit that is at the root of all Bahá’í
teachings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I hope that in spite of the briefness that has been
necessary in answering your interesting questions, I have been able
to explain to you properly the meaning of each answer. It is always
through questioning and mature thought that we can arrive at the root
of everything and in the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh
there are so many things which though at present seemingly
unnecessary will be of great necessity in the future development of
mankind.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wine mentioned in the Tablets has undoubtedly a
spiritual meaning for in the book of Aqdas we are definitely
forbidden to take not only wine, but every thing that deranges the
mind. In poetry as a whole wine is taken to have a different
connotation than the ordinary intoxicating liquid. We see it thus
used by the Persian Poets such as Sa’dí and Umar <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Kh</span></span>ayám
and Háfiz to mean that element which nears man to his divine
beloved, which makes him forget his material self so as better to
seek his spiritual desires. It is very necessary to tell the children
what this wine means so that they may not confuse it with the
ordinary wine.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The books of laws or Aqdas has not yet been properly
translated because as you mentioned we do not have any competent
person for the work. When the Cause was first introduced to west one
of the Arab friends made such an attempt but it was so misleading and
confusing that the Master forbade any individual to make another
trial. He said that it is the work of a group of competent
translators and not of one person. Most of the important subjects
mentioned there are, however, quite familiar to the friends through
other tablets and there is no pressing need for such a work at
present.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">[From the Guardian:]</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Your welcome letter, indicative of your perseverance in
service, despite the great loss you have sustained, was a source of
great comfort and strength to me. I hope and pray that your dear
children will grow in spiritual understanding, wisdom and virtue and
by their life, their conduct and future services to the Cause make
the soul of their departed father radiant and joyous and prove a
solace to your heart. Rest assured that you all occupy a warm and
abiding place in my heart and are the object of my constant and
fervent prayers at the holy Shrines.</p>

has no objection to any such plan of service but would much prefer to
have you consider, in consultation with the friends, the subject from

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">10 September 1931</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to your father’s spiritual testament,
which betrays on the part of the author an inadequate knowledge of
the Bahá’í Faith, the Guardian feels that you
should make it clear to all the inquirers that the late Dr. Forel, as
many other persons who have embraced the Cause, did not have a
complete understanding of the fundamentals of the Bahá’í
religion. He was particularly interested in the social aspect of the
Movement and owing to some psychological reasons he did not lay much
emphasis on its doctrinal side. This can be explained by the fact
that our lamented doctor being advanced in age at the time of his
acquaintance with the Bahá’í teachings was not
able to devote all his time to a deep study of the tenets of the
Faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi, however, in his letter addressed
personally to your father explained to him that the Bahá’ís
should firmly believe in the existence of God and in the immortality
of the soul and in many other fundamental teachings which the Bahá’ís
share with the adherents of many other religions. Our lamented doctor
may have most probably considered it unwise to declare openly that he
had rejected all his previous conceptions in regard to the existence
of God and such similar ideas and preferred to express in an indirect
way the many changes which the knowledge of the Faith had brought in
his mind by declaring that he had become a Bahá’í.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At any rate there is no doubt whatever that the
well-known Tablet revealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for him
had brought a tremendous change in his monistic theories and induced
him to accept the Message openly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However great the contradictions in Dr. Forel’s
testament in regard to his attitude towards the Cause we cannot fail
but to recognize him as a Bahá’í who had but a
partial glimpse of the Bahá’í Revelation. No one
can claim that his knowledge of this Revelation is adequate,
especially at this time when the Bahá’í Faith is
still in the embryonic stage of its development. Dr. Forel was
sincere in his convictions but like every human being his
comprehension was limited and this was not in his power to change.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These are the ideas which came to Shoghi Effendi’s
mind when he read a ‘résumé of Dr. Forel’s
testament in one of the well-known Swiss journals and he wishes you
to share them with all those who are interested to know of the
Doctor’s attitude towards this Movement....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">[From the Guardian:]</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear and valued co-worker:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The passing of your distinguished father has indeed
grieved me profoundly and I wish to assure you of my heartfelt
sympathy in your irreparable loss. I would deeply appreciate a
written account of his eventful life and of the meritorious services
he rendered humanity, either from your pen or any other friend in
Germany, for publication in the next issue of the Bahá’í
World. I feel that his reference to the Cause in the codicil of this
testament indicates the perceptible change in his mental outlook
since he penned the earlier passages of his will, for he must have
known from the Tablet he received as well as from the letters I wrote
him and from many other Bahá’í publications the
fundamental and distinguishing features of the Cause. That is why I
feel that with your consent and approval, the publication of his
references to the Cause in his testament could very well be published
in the Bahá’í World. With my best wishes and
deepest sympathy,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi was very glad to learn that you devote a
considerable amount of your time to the study of the teachings. It is
absolutely essential for those who desire to spread the movement to
be quite familiar with the writings of Bahá’u’lláh
and the Master. Without that knowledge we may be spreading our own
views and wrongly attributing to them things that are the result of
our imaginings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Concerning cremation I have not seen anything in the
writings. But as Bahá’u’lláh in the book of
Aqdas directs the friends to bury their dead, he indirectly
discourages cremation. Whether there is some basic reason for such a
preference he does not say, but we may try and find it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">‘Abdu’l-Bahá does often state that
the medical science will much improve. With the appearance of every
Revelation a new insight is created in man and this in turn expresses
itself in the growth of science. This has happened in past
dispensations and we find its earliest fruits in our present day.
What we see however is only the beginning. With the spiritual
awakening of man this force will develop and marvelous results will
become manifest. Among other phases of human learning the medical
science will have a place. There is a Tablet of Medicine that
Bahá’u’lláh has revealed and which is
translated into English. That does not contain much of scientific
informations but has some interesting advices for keeping healthy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi was very glad to hear that you are
planning to study Persian very seriously. Should you do it you will
obtain ample reward for your labours, for you will then be able to go
straight to the writings themselves.</p>

your beautiful message of Ap. 15th, and he was greatly touched by the
expressions of hope, of devotion and of loyalty which it so
faithfully conveyed, and by the repeated assurances it gave of the
united and continued efforts of your community to extend and
consolidate the foundations of the Faith in your center. Such
repeated evidences of your determination to spread the Message and of
your splendid cooperation in establishing the administrative order of
the Cause in Germany make him invariably think of the promises the
Master did so forcefully give in regard to the future progress of the
Movement in that country. May your endeavours contribute an
increasing share towards the gradual realization of these promises.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi was greatly impressed by the beautiful
marriage ceremony which you had organized in honour of Mr. and Mrs.
Hugo Bender. He hopes that through this union the bonds of
cooperation and of fellowship will be further strengthened between
the members of your community. His prayers for the success of your
activities will continue to be offered to Bahá’u’lláh,
that you may each and all be enabled to assist in the consummation of
the great work He has summoned us to achieve in this Day.</p>

heart. He feels ever so grateful to you for the remarkable spirit and
manner in which you are collaborating for the further consolidation
of Bahá’í administration in your locality. Your
painstaking labours to this end are being surely rewarded and guided
by Bahá’u’lláh Who, as so often promised in

are in such a close touch with the friends in other parts of Germany,
and in particular with those two indefatigable and devoted servants
of the Cause Mrs. A. M. Schweizer and Miss A. Köstlin. Their
frequent and warm visits to Gôppingen are surely of an

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3 August 1935</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He wishes me particularly to convey to you his most
genuine appreciation of your services in connection with the
publication of “La Nova Tago” which he hopes will,
through your efforts and those of the Esperanto-speaking Bahá’ís
both in Germany and abroad, develop gradually into a leading
Esperanto review, and thus become an effective medium for the spread
of Teachings in Esperantist circles throughout the world. It is in
view of the far-reaching possibilities which this publication can
have as a teaching organ, that he has urged the German N.S.A. to
resume its publication when, a few months ago, they had almost
decided to discontinue printing it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to your request for a special article from
the Guardian which you wish to have published in the forthcoming
issue of your magazine. He would suggest that you should translate
his general letter addressed to the friends a few years ago, entitled
“The Goal of a New World Order”, as this, he feels, is a
very suitable material for publication in that review, and is by far
better than anything he can write at present.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to your suggestion regarding a more widespread use of
the Esperanto among the Bahá’ís as a medium of
correspondence. Shoghi Effendi, as you know, has been invariably
encouraging the believers, both in the East and in the West, to make
an intensive study of that language, and to consider it as an
important medium for the spread of the Cause in international
circles. He has been specially urging the friends to have the Cause
well represented in all Esperanto Congresses and associations, and by
this means cultivate greater friendship and cooperation between them
and the Esperantists.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in this connection, he feels, he must make it clear
that although the Cause views with much sympathy and appreciation the
activities which the Esperantists are increasingly initiating for the
spread of their language, yet it considers that the adoption of the
Esperanto by the entire world is by no means an inevitable fact.
Neither Bahá’u’lláh, nor even ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
ever stated that Esperanto will be the international auxiliary
language. The Master simply expressed the hope that it may, provided
certain conditions were fulfilled, develop into such a medium.</p>

claim Esperanto will be the auxiliary language of the future—but,
as we firmly believe in the necessity of an auxiliary language we are
glad to support this work by publishing books in Esperanto and
encouraging the Bahá’ís to learn it, if they wish
to. Cooperation with this society is an excellent means of spreading
the Cause, as Martha Root demonstrated in her travels. However, all
details in this matter must be decided by the N.S.A. You can contact

the German literature of the Faith is of the utmost importance, both

active in the Holy Faith in Plochingen and holding your Feasts and

Shoghi March 1947</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bahá’u’lláh has given His
wonderful teachings and His New World Order to all men; it is up to
each individual to accept this Divine Message and promote its healing
laws and principles for himself. No one can decide for you what you
must do. Your own heart must tell you that your place is serving this
struggling new Faith in the days when it is still, for the most part,
unrecognized by the masses. In the future, when it has won more
adherents, and its true stature becomes obvious to all, it will not
require the courage to sponsor it which it does today!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We must always remember that the administrative Order is
a means to an end, an instrument to co-ordinate and unify the efforts
of the Bahá’ís. It is still imperfectly
understood by them, but very great progress has been made already.
Now, through this administration, it is becoming possible to at last
bring the knowledge of Bahá’u’lláh’s
teachings to the masses, and this is a field you could render great
services in. Your fire, your love for your fellow men, are qualities
much needed in our work, and Shoghi Effendi hopes you will feel the
urge to plunge yourself into the service of this glorious Cause.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Germany there is such a demand for the teachings that
the German Bahá’ís, exhausted from the war and
hampered by restrictions on travel, etc., find it almost impossible
to meet the call on their teaching abilities. They are a very
devoted, well organized Community, but could surely use all the extra
help they can get. If you could see your way clear to go to Germany
and aid them in the teaching work, it would be rendering that
suffering land a great spiritual service.</p>

belief to hold to. This is therefore the time for the Bahá’ís
to teach the Cause as never before, especially to the young people,
and spread the glad tidings that a solution to the world’s
problems exists!</p>

95 believers there, and he hopes this number will steadily and
rapidly increase. All the Bahá’ís, new and old
alike, should devote themselves as much as possible to teaching the
Faith; they should also realize that the atmosphere of true love and
unity which they manifest within the Bahá’í

in mind the responsibility of all the Bahá’ís—in
Stuttgart and elsewhere—towards the purchase and maintenance of
a National Headquarters; this is of the utmost importance, and when
such a headquarters is established it will greatly stimulate the work

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Your letters to our beloved Guardian, dated Feb. 7th and
11th, as well as the manuscript of “Hidden Words” have
been received, and he has instructed me to answer them on his behalf.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He is very happy to have this opportunity of
communicating with you personally, and assuring you of how much he
appreciates your devoted services in the path of our glorious Faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Regarding the questions you have asked him:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no correspondence or connection between the
Hidden Word (Arabic) no. 1 and the last Arabic Hidden Word, or
between these and any passage of the Seven Valleys.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Cairo edition of the Hidden Words, approved by the
Master, is the one you must refer to for accuracy, and disregard all
other texts. This answers the questions connected with Hidden Words
number 18 and 39 and 1 (two) and 35 (two).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hidden Word no. 70: this is not addressed to any person
but is a mystical expression and an allusion to the Manifestation of
God.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No marginal notes should be added except any of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself or the notes of the Cairo
edition.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The whole question of translation from the original text
is very important. He has just written on this subject, at some
length, to Baroness von Werthern, explaining to her that he considers
now is not the time to translate the teachings into German from
Persian and Arabic. No Persian with a sufficient expert knowledge of
German is available to help in this matter; he does not feel,
therefore, that such works as “Some Answered Questions”,
“Seven Valleys”, etc. should be embarked upon at all.
People who have not spent years steeped in the atmosphere and
language and literature of the East cannot possibly grasp the
subtleties of oriental usage. A good example of this very point is
that Prof. Süssheim has not grasped what Bahá’u’lláh
means by the word “[Arabic script]“. He is using it in a
loose and colloquial sense which means “a passing thing”,
a small amount, and not literally associating it with food.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He feels you should continue your study of the teachings
in the original and, from time to time, if you desire to, translate
material from the original in short excerpts; but not at present
important books and Tablets. These you can better translate from good
English editions.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is so much teaching work, and administrative work,
to be done in Germany at present that he urges you to concentrate on
this form of service. The public need to receive the Message on a
large scale, to have available literature at once, to read articles

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was happy to hear the message had been broadcast over
the Radio Frankfurt, and hopes this teaching method can often be
used, as it reaches the people in their homes and many of them would
not attend public meetings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The very encouraging report you sent him of the work in
Germany was most welcome, and he wishes that the National Teaching
Committee or the N.S.A. would send him a statement showing how many
Spiritual Assemblies there are, how many groups and how many isolated
Bahá’ís, and in which cities and towns they are
to be found, respectively.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Generally speaking his instructions to the American
Bahá’ís and their N.S.A. are, whenever they
concern administrative principles and procedure and general
statements about and interpretations of the Faith, binding for all
Bahá’ís everywhere. Naturally specific
instructions to the American Bahá’ís are not
applicable to other communities. “Bahá’í
Procedure”, as Mr. Holley pointed out, is not binding on other
National Assemblies, as many things in it are purely secondary
rulings made by the American N.S.A. to facilitate the work of the
Cause under its jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The believers should certainly, under no circumstances,
drink any alcoholic beverages as this has been forbidden in the
Aqdas. Not all of its laws and precepts can be practiced at present;
but those he has, in his instructions to America, laid down as
applicable at present should be followed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">21 November 1947</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Regarding your questions: by holiness in our Bahá’í
teachings is meant attachment to God, His Precepts and His Will. We
are not ascetics in any sense of the word. On the contrary,
Bahá’u’lláh says God has created all the
good things in the world for us to enjoy and partake of. But we must
not become attached to them and put them before the spiritual things.
Chastity in the strict sense means not to have sexual intercourse, or
sexual intimacies, before marriage. In the general sense it means not
to be licentious. This does not mean we Bahá’ís
believe sexual relations to be impure or wrong. On the contrary they
are natural and should be considered one of God’s many
blessings. He does not know anything about whether albumen and
delicious food affect sex; this is a medical question. Sex is a very
individual matter, some people are more passionate by nature than
others, and might consequently suffer more if forced to be continent.
But when the world becomes more spiritual there will not be such an
exaggerated emphasis on sex, as there is today, and consequently it
will be easier for young people to be chaste and control their
passions. A man of noble character and strong willpower, could
certainly remain faithful to his wife during a long absence!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Any good orientalist could probably refer you to
commentaries on the Qur’án and on the Buddhist
Scriptures. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has stated that all
references of Muḥammad to fighting refer to defensive war, not
to aggression.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unfortunately conditions here in Palestine were so
disturbed and disorganized that the Guardian could not send a message
as you requested, to the Esperanto Congress in Munich in May. He has
been, and is, as you can well imagine, very concerned over the state
of the Holy Land. But so far all has gone well, the Shrines have been
protected, and the Bahá’í Community respected
here and assisted, by the new authorities.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seems as if some time must elapse before pilgrims
from anywhere can again visit here. But he hopes, at a future date,
your heart’s desire will be granted and you will be able to
come to Haifa.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unfortunately the American National Spiritual Assembly
has such a very heavy program to carry out at present, in the
teaching field and in the decoration of the Temple, that many other
projects must wait until more money is available. Printing Bahá’í
Literature is one of them. But he hopes in the near future some new
editions can be gotten out.</p>

They have not only disobeyed him, and flouted his advice and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Regarding your book: he feels that this can only come
under the heading, judging by the outline you gave him, of a romance
woven about a historical episode: the Báb and the events
following His Martyr(dom); we do not know enough concrete facts about
the relation of the Russian Court, the Russian consul, and what exact
part he played in the events of those days to fill a large paragraph!
He feels, therefore, that your book should be presented as such a
romance, and not in any way as a historical narrative.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There were many factors at work in releasing Bahá’u’lláh
from the Síyáh <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Ch</span></span>ál, not the last of
which was the intervention of His own sister who presented very
valuable gifts to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sh</span></span>áh himself while she interceded
for her Brother’s life. So you see your information—not
merely yours, any Bahá’ís at the present time—is
far too scanty to permit of a really historical account being
written. This does not mean you cannot get your book out as a
romance. He certainly would not want you to destroy your manuscript!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First, let me say that one of the reasons God has given
us the institution of Guardianship is to prevent men from
crystallizing the Cause of God into a rigid system. Your questions
are mostly along the line of trying to lay down a fixed pattern for
future society, long before the time for such a pattern is ripe.
Remember that Bahá’u’lláh says what is not
already revealed, the International House of Justice must in the
future legislate, and it can make, and abrogate if necessary, its own
laws. This means not fixity in guiding society, but fluidity!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No. 1 Bahá’u’lláh and the
Master mention only Local, National and an International House of
Justice. There is no provision for divisional ones. Each city will
have its own Spiritual Assembly, not a number of district ones.
Naturally, district 19 Day Feasts can be held where there are very
many Bahá’ís in one city.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No. 2 The Hands of the Cause will have executive
authority in so far as they carry out the work of the Guardian.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No. 3 Spiritual Assembly is the name at present for the
body which in future will be called “House of Justice”.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No. 4 The Badí Calendar will be used generally.
The Bahá’í week has seven days.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No. 5 There is nothing about “ground
organization”. These details are left for future legislation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No. 6 No. Such things are for the consideration of the
legislative bodies in future.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No. 7 No. But ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated
there are other worlds than ours which are inhabited by beings
capable of knowing God.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No. 8 The Bahá’í Temple in America
has been dragging on, uncompleted, since 19..(figures unreadable);
its completion is absolutely essential. We are builders, we have
confidence in the protection of God. We cannot give up our work just
because the atom bomb has been invented! This would be cowardly! The
United Nations disposes of millions and millions of dollars and part
of its work is to educate humanity towards peace and against war. Our
completion of the Bahá’í Temple will cost 3/4 of
a million; what could this sum do in comparison to the efforts of the
United Nations?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The thing the German believers must do is to deepen
themselves in the Covenants of Bahá’u’lláh
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Mere intellectual understanding
of the teachings is not enough. Deep spirituality is essential, and
the foundation of true spirituality is steadfastness in the Covenant.</p>

necessary funds for his trip can be arranged for.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The contact with intellectuals is very important, but so
far, like the early days of Christianity, in the West, few of them
have cared to identify themselves with this young and struggling
Faith of ours! Let us hope, however, that the time is approaching
when they will.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian has been considerably disturbed by the
inharmony that has arisen in Germany. He feels that what the German
Bahá’ís need—and must have—more than
anything else in the world is a far deeper understanding of the
Covenants of both Bahá’u’lláh and the
Master. This is the rock foundation without which no sound
super-structure can be built. Neither the administration, nor the
general teaching work of the Cause in Germany, will progress, or be
able to accomplish anything, unless the believers are truly firm,
deep, spiritually convinced Bahá’ís. An
intellectual grasp of the teachings is purely superficial; with the
first real test such believers are shaken from the bough! But once a
Bahá’í has the profound conviction of the
authority from God, nested in the Prophet, passed on to the Master,
and by Him, to the Guardians, and which flows out through the
assemblies and creates order based on obedience—once a Bahá’í
has this, nothing can shake him. He, therefore, urges you, and the
other members of the N.G.R., to devote as much time as you possibly
can, to educating the believers in the Covenant.</p>

that the difficulties which have arisen in Germany, and which called
forth the letter you rightly felt was likely to cause more harm than
good, are mainly due to the fact that the believers need to be
deepened in their knowledge and appreciation of the Covenants of both
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
This is the stronghold of the Faith of every Bahá’í,
and that which enables him to withstand every test and the attacks of
the enemies outside the Faith, and the far more dangerous, insidious,
lukewarm people inside the Faith who have no real attachment to the
Covenant, and consequently uphold the intellectual aspect of the
teachings while at the same time undermining the spiritual foundation
upon which the whole Cause of God rests.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He feels you and your dear family should do all you can
to teach the believers the Will and Testament to strengthen their
understanding of its important provisions; for all the authority of
the administrative bodies, as well as of the Guardian himself, is
mainly derived from this tremendous document.</p>

in Frankfurt, which is far more central. He realizes at first this

forward in the Cause always is attended by complications and
difficulties. The same was true in America, where for years New York
was the center of the administration for America. When the National

inconvenient, but it now has proved much more convenient and suitable
than New York ever was.</p>

only natural that difficulties should sometimes arise in the course

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The main thing, however, is that all the believers

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">5 June 1949</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">You have asked for his advice about two matters which
concern you very deeply, and although he knows your love for this
Holy Cause will assist you in making the right decisions, he knows it
will be hard for you to do so, and therefore assures you of his
loving prayers that you may take these steps courageously, and that
the way may be made easy for you.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He has heard nothing against the character of Mrs ...
and does not doubt in many ways she may be a very commendable woman.
However, this does not change the fact that in view of her inhered
convictions about Bahá’u’lláh it is best
for the Bahá’ís, including yourself, not to
associate with her. That which is in the heart of those who have
actively opposed the Manifestation of God is spiritually unhealthy,
and although we in our limited human understanding cannot always see
the wisdom of shunning them, the Master has instructed us to do so,
and for our good, and the good of the Cause, we must obey this
instruction.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The matter of your giving up your church membership is a
conscientious obligation. He does not force you to do so, but as you
no longer believe in all the doctrines of your former church, to
continue to be a member of it is really to put yourself in a position
of one who is acting insincerely. Should you decide to withdraw from
the church as a member, however there is no reason why you should not
continue to go to church with your husband, and to continue your
friendly association with the congregation. He will pray that your
husband may be willing for you to take this step.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He fully appreciates your point about certain well-known
names of Persian and other Oriental cities being spelt according to
the general usage in German literature. However, he feels that it is
necessary to follow in full the transliteration used in God Passes
By, even for the names of famous cities, etc., which have in European
languages an accepted way of being spelt. Only by doing this can
confusion be avoided in our Bahá’í translations
and uniformity be maintained.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A key to pronunciation should be printed, in order to
coordinate it with the German language, and also an explanation of
the reason for this system being used: namely that it was adopted by
an international Congress as being the most practical and universal
means of spelling these oriental names in the latin alphabet.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He hopes that the fact that two people translated
different parts of this book will not be noticeable in the style, and

of Germany and Austria</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear Bahá’í Brother:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Your letter of September 3, with enclosed report of the
Bahá’í Youth Summer School, was received, and the
beloved Guardian thanks you for it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He read with interest the report of the activities of
the Youth, and was particularly pleased to see that Dr. Grossmann had
given a course on the Covenant. The Youth must ponder deeply over the
significance and implications of the Covenants of Bahá’u’lláh
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, for these form the hub of the
Bahá’í wheel, so to speak, the point of unity and
strength for all the believers all over the world. Without these
Covenants the Divine Protection of God over this new world Faith
would not exist. Obedience to these Covenants is the stronghold of
all the Bahá’ís, everywhere.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Youth must grasp this fundamental truth, for this
will strengthen them in their service to the Cause, as nothing else
can or will.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another thing he wants the young people to do is to set
an example in obedience to the Administration, and to rise above the
tendency, alas, so pronounced in some of the friends, to consider
personalities instead of principles. This Cause is based on spiritual
laws, and we must consider these, and obey them, and not lose time in
thinking about the individual person’s peculiarities, or
opinions...</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Your letter dated March 27, has been received by our
beloved Guardian, as well as the report of the activities of your
Assembly, and he thanks you for sending him this information.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He, likewise, wishes to thank Mr. Adolf Lorey for his
letter to him of July 30, enclosing a newspaper clipping concerning
Sohrab.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He feels your Assembly, wisely and lovingly, must guide
the friends to a firmer grasp of both the independent nature of our
glorious Faith and the need to study and uphold its Administrative
Order.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To continue to be a member of the church places a Bahá’í
in an insincere position—for we believe the Christ has come
again, in Bahá’u’lláh, and that all His
promises have been gloriously fulfilled. No church would tolerate one
of its members believing such a thing, for the church is still
blindly waiting the second coming. Therefore it is obvious why the
Bahá’ís must leave the church, they are not
leaving Christ, but rather rallying to His support in the new day of
His coming.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Also, he feels your Assembly should obey and work with
the National Assembly in the greatest love and harmony. The past must
be forgotten, and all the believers concentrate, unitedly on the
spread of the Faith and strengthening its administration.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He will pray for you all, and for the success of your
work. With Bahá’í love</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the Guardian already wrote the N.G.R., he feels that
most of the trouble which recently arose in the German community was
due to the fact that the believers everywhere did not seem to know
how to function administratively—almost everything they did was
irregular and this caused added confusion, more wounded feelings, and
confused the entire situation. He trusts that by now the whole
situation has been straightened out and that the N.G.R. and the
assemblies will work strongly and unitedly for the fulfilment of
their Plan.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was very glad that dear doctor Grossmann could attend
the Brussels Conference. All the believers there were so happy to
have a German brother with them! Also, he has received reports of the
excellent teaching work on the Covenant that your dear husband is
doing. This is very important, especially at this time when Ahmad
Sohrab is trying to again become active in Germany.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The German friends must learn to put the teachings above
personalities and stop taking sides. This is a sign of immaturity and
this old and beloved community cannot afford to linger in childhood,
but must become a strong adult community of united, alert and active
believers....</p>

26th, and feels very much pleased at the news of the completion of
the German translation of “The Seven Valleys”. He wishes
me to congratulate you most heartily for this great service you have
been able to render the Cause, and which no doubt will serve to
enrich the record of the manifold contributions you have, during the
last few years, so brilliantly made towards the spread of the Faith
throughout Germany. He is praying to Bahá’u’lláh
that He may continue to guide and inspire you, and assist you in
accomplishing still more outstanding works for the Cause in your
country.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Regarding the publication of the manuscript, he sees no
objection that it should be undertaken by a non-Bahá’í
publisher, inasmuch as it will then have a greater appeal to the
general public. But, of course, in this as well as in all other local
matters of this kind you should first seek the approval of the N.S.A.
As to the expenses of printing the work, they should be preferably
furnished by the national fund.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian is also very much pleased to learn of the
new publications which the N.S.A. is planning to issue very soon. The
printing of the lectures delivered at the last Esslingen Summer
School in a book form is, no doubt, highly useful. It is hoped that
the funds required in this connection, as well as for other important
publications, will be generously contributed by both the individual
believers, and the local groups and assemblies.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With reference to the publication of the “Kitáb-i-Íqán”
into Esperanto, the Guardian also hopes that some action will be
taken in this matter by the N.S.A. But obviously the printing of
this, and other non-German works, should be subordinated to the
publication of Bahá’í literature in German....</p>

cases, this would be quite impossible financially, especially for
people who, like yourself, have the responsibility of families to
look after. No doubt, as the Cause grows in numbers, and has greater
resources, it will be possible to assist the Hands to carry out
definite teaching missions; but for the present, we must stretch our
limited resources, and accomplish the most essential tasks first. He

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tasks of the Auxiliary Boards will be under the
direction of the Hands in their area, and in cooperation with the
administrative bodies existing, to strengthen the teaching work. They
will not have administrative functions, but will no doubt be able to
help stimulate weak centers, groups and assemblies through their
visits.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A Covenant-breaker, as you know, is one who disobeys and
turns away from the Center of the Covenant. Until such time as they

However, such matters should be discussed and decided upon within the
National Spiritual Assembly itself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He is very happy to see the spirit of love and unity
animating you, because without this, no work can go forward in the

melt away in the love of the friends for Bahá’u’lláh,
and their desire to serve His Cause.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He hopes that in the near future the Vienna Community
will have its Hazíratu’l-Quds, to which he attaches the
greatest importance, as it will be the visible sign of the firm
foundation on which that Community stands.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He will pray for you all, and for the rapid spread of
the Faith through your efforts....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">26 March 1956</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many of the problems which you see facing the German
Community are akin to other Bahá’í Communities.
There is a desperate need for deepening the Bahá’ís
themselves in their own faith. They do not study the Teachings
enough. They do not therefore either act as whole-heartedly as
Bahá’ís as they should, or derive the spiritual
strength from the Faith which studying, praying and meditating
brings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The answer of course to many of these problems is that
we need more Bahá’ís to share in the work, more
money to finance traveling teachers, more understanding between the
youth and older people, and a wiser distribution of the work of the
Faith amongst those able to carry it on, whether young or old.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards the question you have asked about your own
obligations, he feels you should not resign from the National
Assembly, as your presence on that Body is of great help in the work.
On the other hand, he approves of your requesting that they do not
give you so much work as a member of the National Assembly, and as a
member of national committees, thus freeing you more for the teaching
work as a “Hand”, and also enabling you to take better
care of your health, which is a precious asset to the Faith.</p>

Community exists there....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As you no doubt know, he has not been satisfied with the
Temple drawings received from Germany, and is now in touch with the
National Assembly regarding possible modifications of some recently
sent him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He considers that the prestige of our beloved Faith is
directly involved with this building; and that what may to an
architect, fond of an advanced style, seem appropriate, would not be
sufficiently dignified to represent our Faith as the first Temple on
the European continent. The problem will no doubt soon be solved. It
merely requires patience and more effort.</p>

unidiomatic, and therefore not very readable to German-speaking
people.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards Dr. Schück’s book, which the
Guardian is very pleased to hear he has written, as we need always
more literature to attract new people to the Faith through different
approaches: Any Bahá’í book presenting the Faith
should be reviewed by a competent body. This only means that they
should ascertain whether there is any misrepresentation of the
Teachings in it. Sometimes the friends think they have to go into
literary reviews and interfere with the author’s style etc.,
which of course is wholly unnecessary. It should therefore not take
long for your National Body or the Italo-Swiss National Assembly to
pass upon the book.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Regarding the matters raised in your letter, as he wrote
you before, he does not feel in this stage in the development of the
Faith and the Institution of the Hands, that the Hands should request
to not be elected on National Bodies, or resign from them. However,
there is no reason why they cannot ask their fellow-members, if they
are elected, to leave them free of the heavier administrative
offices, so that they can do more in their function as Hands. There
is no reason why there should not be a frank discussion of these
problems before the National Assembly itself votes for its Officers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The National Assembly is not obliged to follow the wish

It is also not the Body empowered to tell the Hands what to do; they
can make suggestions to them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards your highly meritorious desire to pioneer
behind the Iron Curtain, he does not feel that this would be
advisable or in the best interests of the Faith. You should continue
your work where you are in Germany, and do all you can, as a Hand and
as a member of the National Body, to see that some pioneers undertake
this important service.</p>

taking up your residence where there is a Group. In this way you will
be strengthening the Home Front, which is also a very important phase
of our Bahá’í activities. If you must go back to
Stuttgart, he hopes you can still live in its neighbourhood and be
instrumental in forming another Assembly, rather than to be just one
more Bahá’í in an already crowded Community. As
you perhaps already know, he has urged the large communities to send
out pioneers. Indeed, if only fifteen Bahá’ís
remained in each city, willing to serve, it would be quite sufficient
to maintain the Spiritual Assembly. The sooner the rest would arise
to pioneer, the better it would be for them and for the Faith.</p>

            against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
            approach us with offers to donate.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and

            originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that
            could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
            eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
            compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corrected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace the old file
            and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file
            is renamed. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Versions</span></em> based on separate sources are treated
            as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
